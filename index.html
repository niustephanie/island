    <p class="sidebar-text"> Christmas Island plays a key but neglected role in Australia’s history of industrial, racial, and social relations. From the late 1950s to the mid-1980s, Christmas Islanders fought to end a longstanding racial apartheid system on the island and demanded wage parity and citizenship rights by unionizing, demonstrating, and exercising collective power. The history of this struggle and its impacts on the present-day island, much of which remains in the memories of living islanders, is minimally documented for future generations.</p>
    <p class="sidebar-text" style="margin-top:0px">
    “Living Museum of Christmas Island” explores opportunities for community archiving to capture Christmas Island’s history and through Islanders’ own lived sense of place. Through community mapping events, augmented reality walking tours, and an interactive photo exhibit, this project aims to better understand how present-day Islanders can help shape the way Christmas Island’s history of social change is understood and remembered.

    <h2>Walking Tour</h2>
    <p>This location-triggered, multi-media walking tour of Christmas Island’s foreshore area will explore social and residential life on the island in the 1960s and 1970s, drawing on original interviews with ex-islanders. This tour will be hosted on the Gesso platform.

    <h2>Talking Maps</h2>
     <p>Talking Maps is a series of community mapping events held on Christmas Island that aims to spark and document location-specific memories about historically significant sites on the island and record them for the future. Each Talking Maps event brings Islanders together at a historic site on Christmas Island to respond to a series of prompts and create individual and collective maps of memory and emotion. </p>

    <h2>Editable Gallery</h2>
    <p>Planned for Territory Week in October 2023, “When Walls Talk Back” is a participatory photo exhibit of never-before-seen photographs of Christmas Island in the 1960s and 70s. <br><br>Displaying photos donated by the late Roland Griffiths-Marsh and his family, this exhibit will depict Christmas Island’s social and cultural life during a key period of change on the island. The exhibit invites attendees, many of whom are long-time Islanders, to contribute to the record by writing directly on photographs, annotating them with knowledge. </p>

  <h2>What are Talking Maps?</h2>
 <p> On Christmas Island, history is alive. The island’s built landscape and present-day residents are reservoirs of knowledge about the island’s lived past. Talking Maps is a series of community mapping events held on Christmas Island that aims to spark and document location-specific memories about historically significant sites on the island and record them for the future. <br><br>

Each Talking Maps event brings Islanders together at a historic site on Christmas Island to respond to a series of prompts and create individual and collective maps of memory and emotion.

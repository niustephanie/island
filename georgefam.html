<h1>Welcome to the George Fam Centre</h1>
<p>Talking Maps is a series of free and open public events that aims to reignite memories of Christmas Island's past and record them for the future. Each Talking Maps event brings Islanders together at a historic site on Christmas Island to tell stories and collaboratively create a series of maps that capture islandersâ€™ lived experience of the site.</p>

    <p>Following the debut of the public event series "Talking Maps" at Christmas Island's George Fam Centre in late May, the workshop received coverage in the island's local newsletter, The Islander. "Participants in the workshop revealed numerous recollections of the George Fam Building from when it was a school until 1987 and the local government offices from 1992," says the article. <br><br> "School memories from a workshop participant revealed boys smoking behind the male toilets (classic), fights on the school bus (what happened on the school bus, stayed on the school bus) and stories of a world war 2, possibly Japanese, concrete pillbox bunker adjacent to the walkable incline where students would visit that has since been demolished." The article also highlighted a key draw of the event- 1970s secondary school canteen food at 1970s prices. "Talking Maps [workshopers] certainly loved the day’s experience – and the 1975 priced school lunch items at the end! 25c nasi lemak, curry puffs, mee siam and delicious Malay dessert kueh!"
